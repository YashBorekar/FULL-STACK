Primitive types are the most basic data types in JavaScript. They are immutable (cannot be changed) and are stored by value.
Here are the 7 primitive data types:

Data Type	Description	             Example
String  	Textual data	      "Hello"
Number  	Numeric values          (integers & floats)	42, 3.14
BigInt	    Large integers           beyond Number limit	123456789012345678901234567890n
Boolean 	True or false	          true, false
undefined	Variable declared   	let x; // undefined
            but not assigned 
            a value
null    	Represents intentional
             absence of value	        let y = null;
Symbol  	Unique and immutable
                 identifiers	    Symbol("id")

Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
Non-primitive types are objects. They are mutable and stored by reference.

Examples include: (),{},[]

Data Type	    Description                      	Example
Object	       Collection of key-value pairs	{ name: "Alice", age: 25 }
Array	        Ordered list of values      	[1, 2, 3, 4]
Function    	Callable object	                function greet(){}
Date, RegExp, etc.	Special built-in object types	new Date(), /abc/
